          struct Data { collections: BTreeMap<u64, Collection>, ... }
      ---- ```
            entity id = (marbleId as u128) & (entityid as u128)
                           ^^^ high               ^^^ low
-           ```
  
  
  
  ** id = (monotonically-increasing u64) << 2 && (entity type)
    *** e.g. 1st token id = 1u64 << 2 && 3u64 = 6u64
      **** good enough? we'll see!
